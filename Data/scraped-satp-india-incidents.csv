"1963",2010-04-19,"A link between the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) and Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) has once again surfaced with the infiltration of two militants, including a Pakistani and a local of Doda in Jammu and Kashmir, from Bamial sector of Gurdaspur District in Punjab on April 19, as reported earlier, according to Daily Times. The militants had surfaced at Chabe Chak in Rajbagh area on April 19 and after a brief contact with Police remained untraced since then. Reports said three suspected guides, who had the history of assisting infiltrators, have gone under ground after the Police operation between Chabe Chak to Billawar forests. A possibility is being explored whether these guides had helped the militants. Official sources said that intrusion of the militants from forward village of Simbal Skole in Bamial sector of Gurdaspur District in Punjab was facilitated by KZF cadre across the International Border (IB) in Pakistan. This has been corroborated by enough on spot evidence as well as messages intercepted on both sides—Gurdaspur and Kathua by the Security Forces (SFs). Reports indicate that a couple of KZF militants might also have infiltrated into Punjab from Bamial sector but the reports have not been corroborated by the security agencies so far. However, a number of KZF literature (Dashmesh Regiment) was recovered by SFs from the border area from where the intrusion took place in the morning of April 19. Recovery of ‘Dashmesh Regiment’, a part of KZF outfit, and literature from the border from where the LeT militants had infiltrated has confirmed that a nexus between the two militant outfits still existed. A close co-ordination between KZF and LeT existed a long back too. However, after the militancy died down in Punjab, the KZF and LeT links were confined to Pakistan. Sources said the intercepts as well as circumstantial evidence have confirmed that it was the KZF network opposite Gurdaspur District in Punjab which had helped the LeT cadre to infiltrate into this side as the militants were finding it difficult to breach fencing in Jammu sector despite making a series of attempts to do so during past few months. Except for Pallanwalla from where a big group of ultras succeeded in infiltration on the intervening night of March 26 and 27, most of other intrusion bids by the militants have been foiled. The LeT leadership, according to sources, is understood to have taken the help of their KZF associates in Pakistan to push the militants into this side as they were running extreme shortage of cadre especially in the wake of killing of almost all 17 militants, who were pushed to this side from Pallanwalla and Nowshera, during encounters with the Army and Police."

"2250",2013-02-21,"Fifteen people were killed and 119 were injured, five of them critically in the twin blasts which happened in quick succession a little after 7 pm, about 100 metres apart in the Dilsukhnagar (Hyderabad Urban District) on February 21, reports NDTV.com. Hyderabad Police sources said that the second bomb had been placed at exactly the same spot that an unexploded bomb was found during the Hyderabad twin blasts of August 25, 2007. The Times of India adds that, Union Minister of Home Affairs, Sushil Kumar Shinde seemed to reflect the principal assumption of the agencies about Indian Mujahideen (IM) being the chief suspects when he said the latest attack was similar to the 2007 serial attacks in the city. The suspicion is derived also from the testimony of the three alleged IM terrorists to Delhi Police in October 2012. Imran, Tabrez and Maqbool told the special cell that they had been assigned to do a recce of Dilsukhnagar and other communally sensitive areas in Hyderabad.Dilsukhnagar has been on the terrorists' radar for long, in 1999 when a bomb was planted near a Hanuman temple. The device was detected in time by Police. It has also been mentioned that Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) targeted Dilsukhnagar in the year 2002, planting a bomb near the Saibaba temple killing two persons.Further, top sources disclosed that the twin blasts bore the signature of the IM. First, the use of cycles to plant IEDs is known to be the modus operandi of the IM, according to Indian Express. A Police official stated, ‘’The IEDs were stuffed with shrapnels, nuts and bolts and pieces of steel which points to the fact that the perpetrators intended to cause maximum damage. The use of this material has been typical of IM. But the paste of the explosives appears to be a mixture of Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and ammonium nitrate but the analysis of NSG will confirm that,’’ PETN has been known to be used by Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)-based militants, particularly the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HUJI). While evidence suggested the role of IM, the use of PETN turned confusing as it is mostly known to be used by J&K terror outfits.The British intelligence had warned India about a possible terrorist attack by IM. The alert led to a general nationwide alert on February 20, reports The Times of India. The British intelligence alert is believed to have been received by Indian agencies just as British Prime Minister David Cameron was about to land in Mumbai on February 18. The Andhra Pradesh Government has set up two special teams which will conduct an independent inquiry to assist the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in handling the case, reports NDTV.

"2608",2017-05-10,"Out of 142 Indian citizens who have been suspected of links with the Islamic State (IS), 85 have either been arrested or interrogated by government agencies, and 11 have been killed, according to Brookings India report, Indian Express reports on May 11. Only 42 are possibly still active abroad — 16 of them in Afghanistan. While there was just the lone case of an ISlinked individual in 2013, and 6 cases in 2014, the number shot up to 35 in 2015, and 75 in 2016. Until the end of April 2017, a total of 35 ISlinked cases involving an Indian citizen had been identified. The researchers have been able to identify 132 out of the 142 individuals by name, using more than one reliable source in each case. Among the 142 Indian citizens, there were only five recruiters and one propagandist; 38 were conspirators and 10 were sympathisers. Fiftyeight (58) individuals were attempted to be recruited, or were successfully recruited.Also at least 66 Indians are known to have attempted to travel to Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya to join IS efforts. This includes not just fighters, but others who pledge allegiance, including family members of fighters. Of these 66, 12 were arrested, detained, or intercepted (3 in Nagpur, 2 each in Delhi and Karnataka, 1 each in Mumbai, Jaipur and Hyderabad, and 1 each in the UAE and Sudan); 2 returned to India on their own before they had reached their destinations; 10 IS fighters are confirmed dead (6 in Syria, 3 in Afghanistan, and 1 in either Iraq or Syria). This means at least 42 Indian IS recruits are possibly still active abroad, although there are unconfirmed reports that many of them have been killed. Sixteen of them are in Afghanistan, 15 in Iraq or Syria, 8 in Syria, and 1 in Libya. The locations of 2 individuals are not known. Most estimates of foreign fighters with IS say the numbers of recruits from Europe, North America, West Asia, former Soviet Union, Southeast Asia and Australia are far higher than from India.The state with the highest number of cases is Kerala (37 individuals), followed by Telangana (21) and Maharashtra (19). Four individuals are from Gujarat, and only 2 from J&K. One 24yearold Kashmiri recruiter and propagandist was deported from the UAE to India last year, while another was based in Australia. Data also show that some of the reported ‘IS’ cases in Kashmir turned out to be the work of nonKashmiris, such as a 26yearold man from West Bengal."
